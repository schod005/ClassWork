To compile, go to each directory 
  app-client/
  app-server/
  dir-server/
and type 
  make

To run the programs, go to the respective directories and run
  ./db-server <port>
  ./dir-server <port>
  ./app-server <dir-port>
  ./app-client <dir-port> <db-port>

The db-server must be started first on atlas.cselabs.umn.edu.  The server
waits for the app-client to connect and either send or receive data.

The dir-server must be started second on apollo.cselabs.umn.edu.  The server
waits for register or list-server commands from the app-servers or app-client.

The app-servers each connect to the dir-server and register their ip/ports.
Then they wait for the app-client to connect and send data to them.

The app-client connects to the dir-server and receives a list of ip/port pairs
to send data to.  Then it connects to each ip/port pair and sends 10KB 100KB
1000KB and 10000KB of data, measuring the time in each case.  The app-client
then connects to the db-server and sends the data to be stored as records.  Then
the app-client asks the db-server for all the stored records and displays them 
to the console.
