Assignment 7

The scullbuffer is a simple character device that will allow concurrent reads 
and writes.  The code base was taken from scull pipe and some modifications
were made to alter it into a character buffer rather than a pipe.

The code for scullbuffer is located in buffer.c

Compiling and installing the scullbuffer device:
--------------------------------------------------
1. Execute Make: 
   make
2. If scull devices already exist then unload them first.
   sudo ./scull_unload
   This may ask you for your root password.
3. Load scull devices
   sudo ./scull_load
   This will create four scull devices (scull0, scull1, scull2, scull3), and one
   scullbuffer device. 

Testing the functioning of scullbuffer  device:
-------------------------------------------------

To run all test cases:
  sudo ./run_tests
This will unload/load the module to ensure the tests run cleanly.

To run tests individually:
  sudo ./scull_unload
  sudo ./scull_load
  ./testcase[1-7]

To run the producers and consumers individually:
  ./producer <num_items_to_produce>
  ./consumer <num_items_to_consume>
