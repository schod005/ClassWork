Need to be done: 

1. Add command line arguments to Client, SuperNode, DHT Node
2. Print structure of DHT (SuperNode provides list of DHT Nodes, Client gets the info)
3. Extend Write() to actually write to the specified file
4. Finish Read() and actually have it read from specified file
5. For Write() and Read(), should print out the nodes visited, the node which contains file
   and the content of file if Read() was called
6. The “Read” and “Write” operations should also have an option of printing out log messages when
   required.
7. Create script to run test cases
8. Need to print error message if file doesn't exist (This may or may not need to be implemented)
